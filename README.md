# Python-Practice

These are some exercises done in Python that look at File Handling, Regular Expressions, and Higher Order Functions (map, filter, reduce). Queue and Heap data structures were also implemented.

File Handling:
A excel sheet fileld with sample data for office supply sales was used in this example. The excel sheet was converted in to .tsv file.
A function was made to traverse through specific columns of the .tsv file and added values in those columns to a dictionary. Those values were printed to the console.
A second function was made to write the data in the dictionary to a .json file. 

Data Structures:
Queue and Heap data structures were implemented. 
Queue:
The Queue data structure was implementing using a class. The Queue class was also used in another function to determine if strings were palindromes.
Heap:
The Heap data structure was implemented and tested using an array. Maximal heap sort was done on an array to test the data structure.
A side ways tree is also implemented in the Heap data structure. 

Regex:
Looked at phone number, domain urls and white spaces using regular expressions. Three functions were made to take string arguments and display boolean values
for these strings. Various valid phone numbers and domain urls were written used regular expressions. Function to remove white spaces before and after strings was also implemented.

Higher Order Functions:
The map filter and reduce functions were implemented on some arrays using lambda programming. 

Sin Approximation: 
The math library in python was used to iterate and generate an approximate value for sin(x).
